synopsis:
  "Computing thousands or millions of digits of PI with arithmetic-geometric means"
description: """
This is a proof of correctness for two algorithms to compute PI to high
precision using arithmetic-geometric means.  A first file contains
the calculus-based proofs for an abstract view of the algorithm, where all
numbers are real numbers.  A second file describes how to approximate all
computations using large integers.  Other files describe the second algorithm
which is close to the one used in mpfr, for instance.

The whole development can be used to produce mathematically proved and
formally verified approximations of PI."""
