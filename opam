synopsis:
  "Formalization of hashtables with Radix trees and PArray"
description: """
This library provides two hashtable structures. They use either Radix trees
and positive integers, or persistent arrays (Coq.PArray) and machine integers.
Their purpose is to be efficient when evaluating the code with Coq's virtual
machine (vm_compute).
